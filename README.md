TraceLink is a system that verifies product authenticity, and lets customers have access to 
detailed history of the product. It is a sophisticated system architecture that combines 3 pivotal 
elements: a user-friendly website interface, QR code functionality, and robotic assistance for 
meticulous and exhaustive piece-by-piece inspections conducted by authorities. 

Luxury companies face huge loses due to fake, cheaper duplicates sold under their brand. 
It is an injustice to labor & production, and can pose health hazards due to illegaly added substances.
Customers currently have no actual way to verify the authenticity of what their buying. 
TraceLink is aimed to be implemented by either respective government authorities, 
or privately – for companies where it matters most. TraceLink aims to combat the adverse
effects of counterfeiting, and guarantee authenticity, fairness to labour, 
consumer safety, and brand credibility.

The system uses blockchain technology to securely store product data - 
id, name, description, quantity, etc. and keep them untouchable. 

• Stores each step of production & logistics
• Represents information using QR codes
• Understands when QR codes are being replicated
• Checks claims on packaging
